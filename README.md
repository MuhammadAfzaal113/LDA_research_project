# LDA_research_project
This repository is concerned with the research paper "Current trends and needs in Software Engineering"
The code scraps data from the top 10 freelancing platforms on runtime and after pre-processing the dictionary is applied on the data set and performs LDA operation.
The results will be given in the CSV format as LDA_results.
The code is provided as verification of results given in the research paper.
Improvement and suggestions will be appreciated.
